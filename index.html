Role: Team member
Title: Substation Monitoring Control System
Description: 
 The main objective of this project is when we give supply to the our prototype all the sensors sensing the current,voltage,frequency and temperature and update all the real time values on the display.it compares all the real time values with the pre-defined values,if any of the values exceeds pre-defined values it sends a fault alert to the relay as well as update in on the display.In the mean time fault gets cleared relays reconnect the loads with the rest os the system.
